The Debian Package oracle-client-package
----------------------------------------

This script helps to build Debian package for Oracle client 10g, 11g.

Oracle client 10g is not mantained by Oracle any more and no longer available for download.

You should download Oracle client software from official Oracle download site by yourself.

The Oracle —Ålient program is governed by the copyright holder (Oracle USA, Inc.), so you may be limited 
as to what you can do with the resulting package (i.e. no redistribution, etc). This utility will simply
help you create the Debian package, it is your responsibility to use the resulting package acordingly
with the OTN license, that you must agree on when downloading the source.
